## Exercise: Implement a User Registration Form

### Description:
Create a user registration form using React. The form should collect basic user information such as name, email, and password. Upon form submission, validate the input fields and display appropriate error messages if any field is invalid.

### Requirements:

- Create input fields for name, email, and password.
- Implement basic validation rules for each field (e.g., name should be at least 3 characters, email should be in a valid format, password should have a minimum length).
- Display error messages for each field that fails validation.
- Disable the form submission button until all fields are valid.
- Upon successful form submission, display a success message.
