## Exercise: Implement a Weather App

### Description:
Create a simple weather application using React. The application should allow users to search for a location and display the current weather conditions for that location. Utilize a weather API to fetch and display the weather data.

### Requirements:

- Include a search input field for users to enter a location.
- Fetch weather data from a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI) based on the entered location.
- Display the current temperature, weather description, and any other relevant weather information for the searched location.
- Handle error cases when the API request fails or returns an error.
- Apply basic styling to enhance the user interface.
